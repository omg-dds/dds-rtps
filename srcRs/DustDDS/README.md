The Dust DDS interoperability executable is built on the dust-dds repository:
https://github.com/s2e-systems/dust-dds/tree/main/omg_interoperability_executable

A GitHub Action is used to build the executable and run interoperability tests with existing executables from
the release attachments from this repository:
