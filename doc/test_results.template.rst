Test Results
============

This page contains a summary of test results for interoperability tests of the
Data Distribution Service速 (DDS速) standard, performed using the Object
Management Group速 (OMG速) interoperability tests available at
https://github.com/omg-dds/dds-rtps.

The test results are organized in the following a spreadsheet. The first tab
presents a comprehensive summary of the tests per product. The first table
delineates the number of passed tests versus total tests, offering a quick
overview of vendor compliance. The second table delineates the tests performed
between products acting as publishers and subscribers, providing insights into
interoperability between different product implementations.

The subsequent tabs represent individual test results per product. Each tab is
named after the respective product and contains two tables:

 * the current product as publisher and all products as subscribers
 * the current product as subscriber and all products as publishers
