# rtps_test_suite_1 is a dictionary that defines the TestSuite. Each element of
# the dictionary is a Test Case that the interoperability_report.py
# executes.
# The dictionary has the following structure:
#       'name' : [[parameter_list], [expected_return_code_list], checking_function]
# where:
#       * name: TestCase's name
#       * parameter_list: list in which each element is the parameters that
#         the shape_main application will use.
#       * expected_return_code_list: list with expected ReturnCodes
#         for a succeed test execution.
#       * checking_function [OPTIONAL]: function to check how the Subscribers receive
#         the samples from the Publishers. By default, it just checks that
#         the data is received. In case that it has a different behavior, that
#         function must be implemented in the test_suite file and the test case
#         should reference it in this parameter.
# The number of elements in parameter_list defines how many shape_main
# applications the interoperability_report will run. It should be the same as
# the number of elements in expected_return_code_list.
