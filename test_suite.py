# rtps_test_suite_1 is a dictionary that defines the TestSuite. Each element of
# the dictionary is a Test Case that the interoperability_report.py
# executes.
# The dictionary has the following structure:
#       'name' : {
#           'apps' : [parameter_list],
#           'expected_codes' : [expected_return_code_list],

#           'title' : 'This is the title of the test',
#           'description' : 'This is a long description of the test'
#       },
# where:
#       * name: TestCase's name
#       * apps: list in which each element contains the parameters that
#         the shape_main application will use. Each element of the list
#         will run a new app.
#       * expected_codes: list with expected ReturnCodes
#         for a succeed test execution.
#       * check_function [OPTIONAL]: function to check how the subscribers receive
#         the samples from the publishers. By default, it just checks that
#         the data is received. In case that it has a different behavior, that
#         function must be implemented in the test_suite file and the test case
#         should reference it in this parameter.
#       * title: human-readable short description of the test
#       * description: description of the test behavior and parameters
#
# The number of elements in 'apps' list defines how many shape_main
# applications the interoperability_report will run. It should be the same as
# the number of elements in expected_codes.

# This constant is used to limit the maximum number of samples that tests that
# check the behavior needs to read. For example, checking that the data
# is received in order, or that OWNERSHIP works properly, etc...
